# swap-xfce-workspaces

Swap/move the current Xfce workspace, with either the next, previous or a specified target workspace.

## Requirements

You need `wmctrl` installed. See: https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/wmctrl/

For Xubuntu, you can do:

```shell
$ sudo apt install wmctrl
```

## Installation

```shell
$ sudo cp swap-xfce-workspaces.sh /usr/bin/swap-xfce-workspaces
```

## Usage

### Swap with specific workspace, by ID

You can swap the current workspace with any other by passing in the target workspace id:

```shell
$ swap-xfce-workspaces <target workspace id>
```

NOTE: This expects XFCE workspace numbers, which start from 1.

### Swap with previous or next workspace

This will move the current workspace left or right, by swapping it with the previous or next workspace:

```shell
$ swap-xfce-workspace prev
$ swap-xfce-workspace next
```
